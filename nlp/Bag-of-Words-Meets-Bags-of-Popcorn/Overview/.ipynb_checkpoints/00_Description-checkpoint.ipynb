    "In this tutorial competition, we dig a little \"deeper\" into sentiment analysis. [Google's Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to [understand meaning](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/08/learning-meaning-behind-words.html) and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis."

    "Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. There's another [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) for movie review sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we explore how Word2Vec can be applied to a similar problem."

    "Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the [front page of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0). These machine learning techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a [drug discovery](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity) task, and [cat and dog image recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)."
